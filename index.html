    <h3>My hobbies</h3>
    <p>Despite the warm water and constant clatter, I actually love my dishwashing job. It's a great way to clear my head and zone out after a busy day. The rhythmic scrubbing and sorting become a kind of meditation, and there's a quiet satisfaction in seeing a mountain of dirty dishes transform into sparkling stacks. Plus, working behind the scenes allows me to observe the cafe's whole operation, and the camaraderie with the cafe staff is a surprising perk. It's more than just cleaning dishes – it's a role that keeps the whole cafe running smoothly. Columbus coffee is my home ♥</p>
